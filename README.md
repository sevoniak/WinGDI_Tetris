# WinGDI_Tetris
Tetris for Windows using the Windows GDI graphics library

## Description
This was made as a challenge to myself to see if I could do it.

## Dependencies
This was made with Visual Studio 2008 for the Windows platform and uses Windows GDI for its graphics library.

## Release
See the release section for a pre-built version for Windows.

## Controls
Use the arrow keys to move the falling blocks, and numpad 1 and 3 to rotate the block. Filled rows are removed from the board. Complete as many rows as you can before the blocks reach the top of the screen.
